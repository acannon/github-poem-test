From a CAT:
Hello
I am a cat
I do cat things
Like sit in boxes
And bite your toes
I also eat a lot
And make messes.

Since you are my human
You will:
Feed me 
Tell me I'm pretty
Throw fake mice
Accept my offerings of real mice
Wake up whenever I want you to
Pet me
But not there.

From a DOG:
Hello new best friend
I have just met you and I love you
I do dog things
Like love you
...
That's it just love
Please remember to feed me and walk me
And love me too.

Cats rule
Dogs drool

Whatever large mean notdog
